* Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. Pragmatic Programmer.
  - Kaizen applies to individuals too. Refine the skills and add new tools.
  - Chapter 1
    - Don't leave broken windows (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.
    - If you don't have time, board it up (e.g., 'Not Implemented')
    - Be a catalyst for change - people find it easier to join an ongoing success.
    - Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring assets.
    - Invest regularly (just like financial portofolio)
    - Learn at least one new language every year.
  - Chapter 2
    - Programmers are constantly in maintenance mode. Maintenance is not a discrete activity, but a routine part of the entire development process.
    - Orthogonality - If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected? The answer should be one.
    - Prototyping generates disposable code. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system.
    - What to say when asked for an estimate - 'I'll get back to you'
  - Chapter 3
    - Keep knowledge in plain text
    - It is better to know one editor very well, and use it for all editing tasks: documentation, memos, system administration, and so on.
    - Always use source code control
    - Debugging is just problem solving, and attack it as such.
    - we want a bug that can be reproduced with a single command.
    - Rubber ducking - try to explain to somebody (who doesn't have to answer)
  - Chapter 4
    - Accept that you can't write perfect software
    - Liskov substitution principal - subclasses must be usable through the base class interface without the need for the user to know the difference
    - Dead programs tell no lies - crash early
    - If it can't happen, use assertions to ensure that it won't

* Steve McConnel. Code Complete, Second Edition, 2009.
  - Chapter 5 Design in Construction
    - Tacoma bridge - only by building the bridge could they learn about the additional consideration in the problem that allowed them build another bridge that still stands
    - Minimize the amount of a program you have to think about at any one time (think of 'mental' juggling) - more balls, more errors
    - Think of a maintenance programmer as your audience, and design the system to be self-explanatory
    - System level diagram (of components like user interface, application level classes, databases, etc) should be an acyclic graph
    - One attribute of great designers - anticipating change.
    - Avoid semantic coupling e.g., module A 'knows' module B's inner workings.

  - Chapter 20 The Software-Quality Landscape
    - Catch problems at the "lowest-value" stage (unit tests, reviews, rather than production)
    - Prototyping can lead to better designs, better matches with user needs, and improved maintainability.
    - No single technique achieves >75% defect detection rate - developers need use a combination of techniques.
    - Variety of errors people found was so great - having two independent groups almost doubles the defects detected.
    - Inspections (code reviews) are several times cost-effective than testing.
    - The best way to improve productivity and quality is to reduce the time spent reworking code (requirement change, design change, or debugging)
        - The single biggest activity is debugging and correcting code that doesn't work properly

  - Chapter 23 Debugging
    - debugging occupies 50% of time of total development time
    - roughly 20x difference in time between experienced and inexperienced programmers to find bugs
    - improving quality reduces development cost -> they are not trade-off
    - it is your best interests to assume an error is your fault
    - Scientific method for debugging: gather data through experiment, hypothesize, prove / disprove
    - Classes that have defects before are likely to continue to have defects
    - "Confessional debugging" - try to explain to someone else and the problems will be solved on its own
    - Take a break when you start feeling anxiety - let your subconscious mind tease out a problem
    - Rewrite a bad code (e.g., in 30mins) rather than debugging it (could take two hours)
    - Understand the problem before you fix it.
    - Achieve a global (or at least, a few hundred lines around) understanding of program rather than focusing it locally
    - Different mindsets for building and debugging code - creative, design thinking, and rigidly critical thinking
    - Set compile warning level to highest and deal with warnings as if they are errors

  - Chapter 24 Refactoring
    - Reason to refactor: code is duplicated, long routines, long parameter lists
    - A subclass only uses small fraction of parent's routines
    - Keep the refactoring small, do one at a time
    - Keep 'parking lots' - list of things you noticed during refactoring but not doing right now
    - Targeting error-prone modules which everyone is afraid of is an effective strategy

  - Chapter 33 Personal Character
    - If you want to be great, you are responsible for making yourself great.
    - Study after study found 10 to 1 difference in speed (of programming and debugging), number of errors.
    - The purpose of many good programming practices to reduce the load on your brain.
    - Humble programmers who compensate for their fallibilities write code that's easier to understand and has fewer errors.
    - Find code written by superior programmers and read it.
    - Programming is only 15 percent communicating with the computer and 85 percent communicating with people.
    - Feeling tempted to compile a program to "see what happens" is a warning sign.
    - It's often better to give up on the error after a certain amount of time (say 15 minutes) with no progress - then think differently.
    - The value of 'hands-on' experience is small - 'five years of C programming experience' is a silly statement - If a programmer hasn't learned C after a year or two, the next three years won't make much difference.
    - When you first learn something, learn it the right way - this forms good habits.

* Clean Code
  - 17 Smells and Heuristics
    - When you see commented-out code, delete it!
    - Functions should have a small number of arguments --- more than three is very questionable.
    - Boolean arguments loudly declare that the function does more than one thing.
    - Prefer non-static methods to static methods (make sure that there is no chance that you'll want it to behave polymorphically.)
    - Make sure you understand how algorithms/functions work before. It is not good enough that it passes all the tests. You must know that the solution is correct.
    - Exhaustively test near bugs - bugs tend to congregate.

* David Beazley and Brian K. Jones. Python Cookbook, Third Edition, 2013.
  - Chapter 1
    - Python 3 supports star expressions for unpacking: first, * middle, last = data
    - from collection import deque -> keep the last N elements pushed
    - heapq -> heap, supports O(1) min() and O(log n) push.
    - OrderedDict -> preserves the order of keys
    - Python 3 dict.keys() -> set, not list, support intersection, union, diff, etc.
    - Name a slice by slice(st, ed) (supports start, stop, step)
    - Python >= 2.7 supports Counter (from collections) - dict subclass for counting iteratives
    - itemgetter and attrgetter in operator can be used for sort key func (instead of lambda)
    - namedtuple's replace() can create a new instance with a value replaced
  - Chapter 2
    - str.startswith and endswith takes a tuple (for multiple possibilities)
    - from fnmatch import fnmatch, fnmatchcase -> Unix-like file name wildcard
    - unicodedata.normalize(form, str) form: NKC (normal form decomposition -> composition) NKD (normal form decomposition)
    - newer codes should prefer format over "%". format also supports aligning and variable interpolation.
  - Chapter 3
    - useful random functions: choice, sample, shuffle, getrandbits
    - datetime.strftime() can be slow -> use custom function instead if there are a lot of strings to process
    - use pytz to deal with timezones
  - Chapter 4
    - yield from (generator delegation) expression -> from Python 3.3
    - reversed() can be implemented by __reversed__() (reverse iterator)
    - iterators can be sliced by itertools.islice(), dropwhile()
    - introduction of itertools.combinations, permutations, zip_longest, chain
    - iter(callable, sentinel) -> loop while the return value is not equal to the sentinel
  - Chapter 5
    - object implementing 'buffer interface' -> exposes underlying memory buffer -> can directly write() and readinto()
    - __setstate__() and __getstate__() for pickle -> set and get internal states
  - Chapter 6
    - serialize_instance() and unserialize_instance() for JSON serialization of instances
    - Use memoryview() to avoid unnecessary copies (like slices) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18655648/what-exactly-is-the-point-of-memoryview-in-python
    - Default function arguments are evaluated only once (at the time of function definition)
    - Use instance test ("is") with a global "object()" to test if any values (including 0, [], None) are passed to default argument
  - Chapter 7
    - lambda: Capture the value at the time of definition using the default value: e.g., lambda x, n=n
  - Chapter 8
    - Use "!r" format string to force repr() instead of str()
    - format() can be customized by __format__()
    - Creating getter/setter -> decorate by @[attname], @[attname.setter], @[attname.deleter]. Don't write getters/setters unless necessary (e.g., type/value check)
    - Descriptors: reusable, generalized properties. see http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/ChrisBeaumont/5758381/descriptor_writeup.ipynb
    - Bypass __init__() by involing __new__() directory (e.g., JSON deserialization)
    - Python ast (abstract syntax tree, using in Python compilation) uses the visitor pattern
    - Python's GC is simple refernece counting. You can use weakref to reference to an object without increasing the count.
  - Chapter 9
    - functools.wraps -> Update the wrapper function to look like the wrapped function (e.g., name & docstring)
    - Metaclasses -> class of class (e.g., 'type'), change behaviors of classes by defining __new__, __init__ (with clsname, bases, clsdict)

* MIT Technology Review Business Report: Data and Decision Making http://www.technologyreview.com/businessreport/data-and-decision-making/download/
  - 1-800-Dentist A/B test to optimize fill out the form using "Optimizely" (by ex-Googler, used Obama campaign, putting personal message from President increased fund-raising by 14%), at least 15% of top 10K websites run A/B tests
  - A Google designer quit because Google cannot decide between two blues so it tested 41 shades...
  - Uncritical reliance on data alone can be problematic, but so is overreliance on intuition or ideology. (e.g., Ron Johnson, CEO of JC penny)
  - Importance of a scientific mindset for decision making (hypothesis -> test by data) - most plausible human explanation is not necessarily correct. Do not infer too much from any one outcome
  - Experimentation, especially controlled experiments to tease out causal effects, not correlation
  - Palantir, PayPal - suite of fraud analysis tools for humans to act on suspicious activities
  - Licklider (Man-Computer Symbiosis) influenced IBM's "cognitive computing" virtual assistant + brain-like chips
  - Linkedin's University Pages - appeal to under 18 users, to show statistics on graduates' careers (e.g., MIT graduates tend to land on Google, IBM, and Oracle)
  - IBM Watson, 2000 engineers working on it, combining other cognitive technologies, including voice and image -> e.g., simple conversations for a call center
  - Reis ("The Lean Startup") technology risk isn't the problem anymore. Market risk is.
  - Correlation Ventures http://www.correlationvc.com/ - pick companies by algorithms

* Peter Thiel "Zero to One"

  - "Every moment in business happens only once. [...] The next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."
  - "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" - "Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more." "What valuable company is nobody building?"
  - "A bad plan is better than no plan."
  - Google is a monopoly in search but a small player in ads
  - All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem.
  - "the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?"
  - "proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage." (e.g., Amazon, 10 times as many books as any other bookstores)
  - every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it's easier to dominate a small market than a large one.
  - biotech startups indefinite approach to business
  - "Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won't help you find the global maximum."
  - Mark Zuckerberg didn't sell Facebook to Yahoo! for $1B in July 2006 - "A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random."
  - Albert Einstein "compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe."
  - venture returns follow a power low: "a small handful of companies radically outperform all others."
  - investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible.
  - "It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future."
  - there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers.
  - Thiel's law: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.
  - how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much
  - "Why would someone join your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google far more money and more prestige?" - two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team.
  - Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same reponsibilities - make one person responsible for doing just one thing
  - poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure.
  - "big data"   is usually dumb data. "Most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they'll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?"
  - doing something different is what's truly good for sociery --- it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market
  - no sector will be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company
