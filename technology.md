* David Beazley and Brian K. Jones. Python Cookbook, Third Edition, 2013.
  - Chapter 1
    - Python 3 supports star expressions for unpacking: first, * middle, last = data
    - from collection import deque -> keep the last N elements pushed
    - heapq -> heap, supports O(1) min() and O(log n) push.
    - OrderedDict -> preserves the order of keys
    - Python 3 dict.keys() -> set, not list, support intersection, union, diff, etc.
    - Name a slice by slice(st, ed) (supports start, stop, step)
    - Python >= 2.7 supports Counter (from collections) - dict subclass for counting iteratives
    - itemgetter and attrgetter in operator can be used for sort key func (instead of lambda)
    - namedtuple's replace() can create a new instance with a value replaced
  - Chapter 2
    - str.startswith and endswith takes a tuple (for multiple possibilities)
    - from fnmatch import fnmatch, fnmatchcase -> Unix-like file name wildcard
    - unicodedata.normalize(form, str) form: NKC (normal form decomposition -> composition) NKD (normal form decomposition)
    - newer codes should prefer format over "%". format also supports aligning and variable interpolation.
  - Chapter 3
    - useful random functions: choice, sample, shuffle, getrandbits
    - datetime.strftime() can be slow -> use custom function instead if there are a lot of strings to process
    - use pytz to deal with timezones
  - Chapter 4
    - yield from (generator delegation) expression -> from Python 3.3
    - reversed() can be implemented by __reversed__() (reverse iterator)
    - iterators can be sliced by itertools.islice(), dropwhile()
    - introduction of itertools.combinations, permutations, zip_longest, chain
    - iter(callable, sentinel) -> loop while the return value is not equal to the sentinel
  - Chapter 5
    - object implementing 'buffer interface' -> exposes underlying memory buffer -> can directly write() and readinto()
    - __setstate__() and __getstate__() for pickle -> set and get internal states
  - Chapter 6
    - serialize_instance() and unserialize_instance() for JSON serialization of instances
    - Use memoryview() to avoid unnecessary copies (like slices) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18655648/what-exactly-is-the-point-of-memoryview-in-python
    - Default function arguments are evaluated only once (at the time of function definition)
    - Use instance test ("is") with a global "object()" to test if any values (including 0, [], None) are passed to default argument
  - Chapter 7
    - lambda: Capture the value at the time of definition using the default value: e.g., lambda x, n=n
  - Chapter 8
    - Use "!r" format string to force repr() instead of str()
    - format() can be customized by __format__()
    - Creating getter/setter -> decorate by @[attname], @[attname.setter], @[attname.deleter]. Don't write getters/setters unless necessary (e.g., type/value check)
    - Descriptors: reusable, generalized properties. see http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/ChrisBeaumont/5758381/descriptor_writeup.ipynb
    - Bypass __init__() by involing __new__() directory (e.g., JSON deserialization)
    - Python ast (abstract syntax tree, using in Python compilation) uses the visitor pattern
    - Python's GC is simple refernece counting. You can use weakref to reference to an object without increasing the count.
  - Chapter 9
    - functools.wraps -> Update the wrapper function to look like the wrapped function (e.g., name & docstring)

* Brian W Kernighan and Rob Pike. The Unix Programming Environment. 1983.
  - Chapter 1
  - Chapter 2
    - "sed-uid" bit - grand the permission of the owner when run (used for passwd command)
    - "read" and "execute" permission for directories - "read" the file names of the directory, "execute (search)" to actually retrieve the file. "write" permission required to move/delete the files
    - /dev info: character (c) or block (b), the major number (type) and the minor number (distinguishes different devices)
    - /dev/tty -> terminal (used by crypt to receive the password input)
    - dot "." shell built-in command: execute a script in the current environment (variables are overwritten) or prefix any commands with var=val
  - Chapter 4
    - filters. egrep (extended) and fgrep (fast), now consolidated into the same program (grep)
    - sed convenient command (e.g., sed -n '20,30p' -> print lines 20-30, sed '1d' -> print except the first line)
    - awk special variables: NR (line number), FS (field separator), built-in functions (e.g., length)

* MIT Technology Review Business Report: Data and Decision Making http://www.technologyreview.com/businessreport/data-and-decision-making/download/
  - 1-800-Dentist A/B test to optimize fill out the form using "Optimizely" (by ex-Googler, used Obama campaign, putting personal message from President increased fund-raising by 14%), at least 15% of top 10K websites run A/B tests
  - A Google designer quit because Google cannot decide between two blues so it tested 41 shades...
  - Uncritical reliance on data alone can be problematic, but so is overreliance on intuition or ideology. (e.g., Ron Johnson, CEO of JC penny)
  - Importance of a scientific mindset for decision making (hypothesis -> test by data) - most plausible human explanation is not necessarily correct. Do not infer too much from any one outcome
  - Experimentation, especially controlled experiments to tease out causal effects, not correlation
  - Palantir, PayPal - suite of fraud analysis tools for humans to act on suspicious activities
  - Licklider (Man-Computer Symbiosis) influenced IBM's "cognitive computing" virtual assistant + brain-like chips
  - Linkedin's University Pages - appeal to under 18 users, to show statistics on graduates' careers (e.g., MIT graduates tend to land on Google, IBM, and Oracle)
  - IBM Watson, 2000 engineers working on it, combining other cognitive technologies, including voice and image -> e.g., simple conversations for a call center
  - Reis ("The Lean Startup") technology risk isn't the problem anymore. Market risk is.
  - Correlation Ventures http://www.correlationvc.com/ - pick companies by algorithms

* Peter Thiel "Zero to One"

  - "Every moment in business happens only once. [...] The next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."
  - "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" - "Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more." "What valuable company is nobody building?"
  - "A bad plan is better than no plan."
  - Google is a monopoly in search but a small player in ads
  - All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem.
  - "the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?"
  - "proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage." (e.g., Amazon, 10 times as many books as any other bookstores)
  - every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it's easier to dominate a small market than a large one.
  - biotech startups indefinite approach to business
  - "Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won't help you find the global maximum."
  - Mark Zuckerberg didn't sell Facebook to Yahoo! for $1B in July 2006 - "A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random."
  - Albert Einstein "compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe."
  - venture returns follow a power low: "a small handful of companies radically outperform all others."
  - investors who understand the power law make as few investments as possible.
  - "It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future."
  - there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers.
  - Thiel's law: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.
  - how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much
  - "Why would someone join your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google far more money and more prestige?" - two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team.
  - Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same reponsibilities - make one person responsible for doing just one thing
  - poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure.
  - "big data"   is usually dumb data. "Most valuable companies in the future won't ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they'll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?"
  - doing something different is what's truly good for sociery --- it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market
  - no sector will be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company
