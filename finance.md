  - It is not hard to make money in the market. As we shall see later, an investor who simply buys and holds a broad-based portfolio of stocks can make reasonably generous long-run returns. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.
  - most Internet traders actually lost money even during the bubble, systematically buying and selling the wrong stocks, and that they performed worse the more they traded.
  - Portfolio managers are not worth the money you pay for them.
  - Correlation of past price movements with present and future price movements is very close to zero.
  - analysts' strong buy recommendations underperformed the market as a whole by 3 percent per month
  - Benjamin Graham - fundamental security analysis could no longer be counted on to produce superior investment returns
  - Odean and Barber research: the more individual investors traded, the worse they did. And male investors traded much more than women, with correspondingly poorer results.
  - the correct holding period for the stock market is forever
  - the decision not to sell is exactly the same as the decision to buy the stock at the current price
  - stock returns over longer horizons, such as two years or more, display negative serial correlation
  - "Trust in time rather than timing"
  - interest payments on your mortgage and property taxes are deductible from income tax
  - Advice: own your own home if you an possibly afford it
  - If you do want to pick stocks yourself, I strongly suggest a mixed strategy: Index the core of your portfolio, and try the stock-picking game for the money you can affort to put at somewhat greater risk.

  - Chapter 1:
    - economics is the social science concerned with how individuals, institutions, and society make optimal hoises under conditions of scarcity.
    - utility - the pleasure, happiness, or satisfaction obtained from consuming a good or service.
    - marginal analysis - comparisons of marginal benefits and marginal costs, usually for decision making. ("marginal" = "extra" "additional")
    - positive economics deals with factual statements ("what is"); normative economics involves value judgements ("what ought to be")
    - resource categories: land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability
    - law of increasing opportunity costs = production of a unit is more costly (in terms of opportunity cost) as the production grows
    - optimal amount of the activity occurs where MB (marginal benefit) = MC (marginal cost)
