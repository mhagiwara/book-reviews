  - It is not hard to make money in the market. As we shall see later, an investor who simply buys and holds a broad-based portfolio of stocks can make reasonably generous long-run returns. What is hard to avoid is the alluring temptation to throw your money away on short, get-rich-quick speculative binges.
  - most Internet traders actually lost money even during the bubble, systematically buying and selling the wrong stocks, and that they performed worse the more they traded.
  - Portfolio managers are not worth the money you pay for them.
  - Correlation of past price movements with present and future price movements is very close to zero.
  - analysts' strong buy recommendations underperformed the market as a whole by 3 percent per month
  - Benjamin Graham - fundamental security analysis could no longer be counted on to produce superior investment returns
  - Odean and Barber research: the more individual investors traded, the worse they did. And male investors traded much more than women, with correspondingly poorer results.
  - the correct holding period for the stock market is forever
  - the decision not to sell is exactly the same as the decision to buy the stock at the current price
  - stock returns over longer horizons, such as two years or more, display negative serial correlation
  - "Trust in time rather than timing"
  - interest payments on your mortgage and property taxes are deductible from income tax
  - Advice: own your own home if you an possibly afford it
  - If you do want to pick stocks yourself, I strongly suggest a mixed strategy: Index the core of your portfolio, and try the stock-picking game for the money you can affort to put at somewhat greater risk.

  - Chapter 1:
    - economics is the social science concerned with how individuals, institutions, and society make optimal hoises under conditions of scarcity.
    - utility - the pleasure, happiness, or satisfaction obtained from consuming a good or service.
    - marginal analysis - comparisons of marginal benefits and marginal costs, usually for decision making. ("marginal" = "extra" "additional")
    - positive economics deals with factual statements ("what is"); normative economics involves value judgements ("what ought to be")
    - resource categories: land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability
    - law of increasing opportunity costs = production of a unit is more costly (in terms of opportunity cost) as the production grows
    - optimal amount of the activity occurs where MB (marginal benefit) = MC (marginal cost)
  - Chapter 2:
    - Money: barter poses serious problem: requires coincidence of wants between the buyer and the seller
    - Money is socially defined; whatever society accepts as a medium of exchange is money.
    - Consumer sovereignty is crucial in determining the types and quantities of goods produced. "dollar wars"
    - Market: gigantic communications system (between consumers and producers, through prices and profits)
    - Invisible hand ensures that when firms maximize their profits and resource suppliers maximize their incomes, these groups also help maximize society's output and income
  - Chapter 3:
    - Demand: quantities of a product that will be purchased at various possible prices. (simply a statement of a buyer's plans, or intentions, with respect to the purchase of a product.)
    - Diminishing marginal utility: consumers will buy additional units only if the price of those units is progressively reduced.
    - Superior (normal) goods: products whose demand varis directly with money income (<=> inferior goods)
    - Substitutes & Complements = sets of two product whose demands are negatively/positively related
    - Supply: schedule or curve showing the various amounts of a product that are producers are willing and able to make available for sale
    - Problem on price floor/ceiling: e.g., rent controls distort market signals and thus resources are misallocated: too few resources are allocated to rental housing and too many to alternative uses.
  - Chapter 6:
    - Price elasticity: percentage change in quantity demanded per percentage change in price
    - Total revenue test - total revenue increase if price increases -> demand is elastic
    - slope of the (demand / supply) curve -> computed from absolute changes
    - legislatures tend to seek out products that have inelastic demand --- such as liquor, gasoline, and cigarettes -- when levying excises
    - Cross elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded (product X) / % change in price of product Y (substitute -> positive, complements -> negative)
    - Consumer surplus = different between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a product, and the actual price
    - All markets with downward-sloping demand curves and upward-sloping supply curves yield consumer and producer surplus
    - Price discrimination: why lower price for children? because children have more elastic demands than adults because children have low budgets, often financed by their parents (even though the business cost for children is almost the same)
