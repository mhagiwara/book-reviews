Leadership, Mentoring
---------------------

* HBR Guide to Getting the Mentoring You Need, 2014, http://hbr.org/product/hbr-guide-to-getting-the-mentoring-you-need/an/11959E-KND-ENG
  - Companies provide mentoring in an "arranged marriages" way between organizational veterans and newbies. Force relationship instead of allowing them to develop organically through mutual trust and respect
  - "Sponsorship" - the relationship between sponsor (senior managers with influence; not only mentoring but also advocacy and tactical means of realizing it) and protégé works best when it helps both parties.
  - Mentoring: get multiple mentors ("board of directors" for your career), think of mentoring as something you tap when you need it. Not only senior->junior but could be junior->senior (e.g., new technology)
  - "Become experts in some specific business area in order to build confidence."
  - Develop complementary skills (e.g., tech vs communication) instead of doing what you already do well
  - "Interaction effect" (e.g., combining diet with exercise) correlation between leadership effectiveness and pairings of 16 competencies (e.g., "innovates" - "Is willing to take risks and challenge the status quo" "Support others in risk taking")
  - How to find mentor - just directly ask (send out 15 letters after research). invisible mentor, someone to learn from
  - Product mentoring demands candor, but **what happens there stays there**
  - "Beware of mentoring that demands too little of you: If your mentor isn't providing regular assignments that sync up with your overall plan, ask for them"
  - "Effective mentoring requires hard work and commitment from menteers and mentors alike"
  - In terms of networking, its diversity (not size) counts - diverse but select networks, made up of high-quality relationships with people from several different spheres and from up and down the corporate hierarchy
  - **"Energizers bring out the best in everyone around them, and our data show that having them in your network is a strong predictor of success over time"** vs "Roughly 90% of anxiety at work is created by 5% of one's network - the people who sap energy."
  - When you sign up for responsibilities outside work, try to choose ones that build on your expertise. (managing projects -> school committee)
  - Senior role: "Success, in either case, now depends on your ability to create an environment where other people can shine."
