Leadership, Mentoring
---------------------

* HBR Guide to Getting the Mentoring You Need, 2014, http://hbr.org/product/hbr-guide-to-getting-the-mentoring-you-need/an/11959E-KND-ENG
  - Companies provide mentoring in an "arranged marriages" way between organizational veterans and newbies. Force relationship instead of allowing them to develop organically through mutual trust and respect
  - "Sponsorship" - the relationship between sponsor (senior managers with influence; not only mentoring but also advocacy and tactical means of realizing it) and protégé works best when it helps both parties.
  - Mentoring: get multiple mentors ("board of directors" for your career), think of mentoring as something you tap when you need it. Not only senior->junior but could be junior->senior (e.g., new technology)
  - "Become experts in some specific business area in order to build confidence."
  - Develop complementary skills (e.g., tech vs communication) instead of doing what you already do well
  - "Interaction effect" (e.g., combining diet with exercise) correlation between leadership effectiveness and pairings of 16 competencies (e.g., "innovates" - "Is willing to take risks and challenge the status quo" "Support others in risk taking")
  - How to find mentor - just directly ask (send out 15 letters after research). invisible mentor, someone to learn from
  - Product mentoring demands candor, but **what happens there stays there**
  - "Beware of mentoring that demands too little of you: If your mentor isn't providing regular assignments that sync up with your overall plan, ask for them"
  - "Effective mentoring requires hard work and commitment from menteers and mentors alike"
  - In terms of networking, its diversity (not size) counts - diverse but select networks, made up of high-quality relationships with people from several different spheres and from up and down the corporate hierarchy
  - **"Energizers bring out the best in everyone around them, and our data show that having them in your network is a strong predictor of success over time"** vs "Roughly 90% of anxiety at work is created by 5% of one's network - the people who sap energy."
  - When you sign up for responsibilities outside work, try to choose ones that build on your expertise. (managing projects -> school committee)
  - Senior role: "Success, in either case, now depends on your ability to create an environment where other people can shine."
  - Second time around we learn by teaching someone else to do what we do. It's this second-time-around learning that turns good professionals and managers into great ones.


* Liz Wiseman: Multipliers, HarperBusiness, 2010.
  - Research: 150 leaders through interviews and a quantitative assesment
  - "he [George Schneer at Intel] spoke only about 10 percent of the time, mostly just to "crisp up" the problem statement. He would then back away and give his team space to figure out an answer.
  - "It isn't how much you know that matters. What matters is how much access you have to what other people know. It isn't just how intelligent your team members are; it is how much of that intelligence you can draw out and put to use."
  - Children given the same series of puzzles but then praised for their hard work actually increased their ability to reason and to solve problems (cf student's IQ levels drop over summer vacation)
  - "Most people in organizations are underutilized."
  - Multipliers see intelligence as continually developing (= Carol Dweck's "growth mindset") work as "investors"
  - [multiplers] remove fear and create the safety that invites people to do their best thinking. But they also create an intense environment that demands people's best effort. "They look into people and find capability, and they want to access all of it. They utilize people to their fullest. They see a lot, so they expect a lot."
  - "You can learn to become [a multipler]"
  - Multipliers aren't deterred if someone doesn't officially report to them on an org chart.
  - Find people's genius: What do they do readily without being paid?
  - Introduce someone as "xxx genious" - re-inforce self recognition
  - "[Liberators] create both comfort and pressure in the environment. In the eyes of the Liberator, it is a just exchange: I give you space; you give me back your best work."
  - "Release Others by Restraining Yourself"
  - Operating with consistency is one of the most vital of the practices of the Liberator.
  - 'How smart do you have to be to be a Multipler? The answer "You have to be smart enough to learn."'
  - Label the difference between a random musing, an opinion, and a poilicy decision.
  - "The number one difference between a Nobel prize winner and others is not IQ or work ethic, but that they ask bigger questions." - Peter Drucker
  - people get smarter by being challenged.
  - Multipliers don't just give ideas to people. They provide just enough information to provoke thinking and to help people discover and see the opportunity for themselves.
  - Multiplers begin with small, early wins and use those to generate belief toward the greater stretch challenge (e.g., Wangari Maathai)
  - multipliers' practice = intellectual curiosity
  - Extreme Question Challenge: "only speak to your children in the form of questions. No orders."
  - Rigorous debate doesn't break down a team; it builds team and makes the team stronger
  - "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." - Antoine de St. Exupery
  - The leader helps, offers suggestions, asks great questions and may escalate a critical issue, but the accountability slides back and rests with their staff.
  - your subordinates have more insights because they are working longer on issues
  - As a manager, my job was no longer about me. It was my responsibility to manage the work, not do the work.
  - "What would happen if you gave yourself permission to be better than your boss?"
  - "leaders do not need to be good at everything. They need to have mastery of a small number of skills and be free of show-stopper weaknesses."
  - great sauce of a great debate is what they do before the debate actually begins.
  - practice for multipliers: 1) neutralize a weakness and 2) top off a strength
  - best work is done when one can hold a single question for a long time. "What is the question that you are asking yourself this year?"
