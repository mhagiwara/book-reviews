*  Greg McKeown "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" Crown Business, 2014.
  - "only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter."
  - "Weniger aber besser." (German) -> "Less but btter"
  - "Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it's about how to get the right things done."
  - "The undisciplined pursuit of more" was a key reason for failure of Wall Street great companies.
  - "Almost everything is noise, and a very few things are exceptionally valuable."
  - "The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" -> Explore, Eliminate, and Execute!
  - "If you could do only one thing with your life right now, what would you do?"
  - "learned helplessness" - experiment on German shepherds where dogs who took electric shocks didn't know they even have any choices
  - Warren Buffet and his firm make relatively few investments and keep them for a long time. "Sometimes what you don't do is just as important as what you do."
  - Instead of asking, "What do I have to give up?" they [essentialists] ask, "What do I want to go big on?"
  - "Without great solitude no serious work is possible." - Pablo Picasso
  - Bill Gates takes a regular week off (at Microsoft) simply to think and read.
  - "Play doesn't just help us to explore what is essential. It is essential in and of itself."
  - "The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves."
  - Bill Clinton: every major mistake he had made in his life had happened as a result of sleep deprivation.
  - Violinist study: great violinists practice more than "good" ones do. They sleep longer, too
  - "If the answer isn't a definite yes then it should be a no."
  - "if there's one thing you are passionate about -- and that you can be best at -- you should do just that one thing."
  - Make an "Essential intent" both inspirational and concrete. e.g., "To get everyone in the U.K. online by the end of 2012." How will we know when we have succeeded?
  - "either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years."
  - Saying "no" gracefully doesn't have to mean using the word "no" e.g., "Let me check my calendar and get back to you", pause before speaking
  - "Sunk-cost bias" -> tendency to keep investing on what already lost money
  - "If I weren't already invested in this project, how much would I invest in it?" - pretent you don't own it yet (aka zero-based budgeting)
  - Why adults are vulnerable to the sunk-cost bias? -> "don't waste" rule
  - Simply add 50 percent buffer to the estimate to complete a task
  - HBR article: two internal motivators: achievement and recognition for achievement
  - A popular idea in Silicon Valley is "Done is better than perfect."

* Joel Spolsky "Smart and Gets Things Done: Joel Spolsky's Concise Guide to Finding the Best Technical Talent" Apress, 2007
  - "if you can eliminate one obstacle -- just one! -- you can double the number of people you hire."
  - "design adds value faster than it adds cost"
  - Research on CS 323, programming-intensive course: "The quality of the work and the amount of time spent are simply uncorrelated."
  - '"average productive" developer never hits the high notes that make great software.'
  - "The software marketplae, these days, is something of a winner-take-all system."
  - "The great software developers, indeed, the best people in every field, are quite simply never on the market."
  - 1. Go to the mountain (= interesting tech conferences)  2. Internships  3. Build your own community* (=hard)
  - "it's really important that the ones who do pass have a positive experience. Even the ones who don't make it go back to campus thinking we're a classy employer and tell all their friends how much fun they had staying in a luxury hotel in the Big Apple"
  - All else being equal, developers are going to prefer an organization that treats them like starts.
  - "one of the best ways you can attract developers is to let them work on something interesting."
  - "Use Cool New Technologies Unnecessarily"
  - "as long as the salaries are basically fair, they will be surprisingly low on their [programmers'] list of considerations"
  - certain programming languages or technologies on a resume indicate evidence of someone who loves programming enough to explore new technologies (e.g., Ruby)
  - advice: "take a class in Econ so that the business side of the business isn't a mystery."
  - Interview: 'Never say "Hire, but not for my team."'  'Never say, "Maybe, I can't tell." If you can't tell, that means No Hire.'
  - never, ever talk to the other interviewers about the candidate until you've both made your decisions independently. That's the scientific method.
  - "understanding pointers in C is not a skill, it's an aptitude." "For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands pointers."
  - "when you find the smart, gets-things-done candidate, you'll know it."
  - "in a high-tech company the individual contributors always have more information than the 'leaders,' so they are really in the best position to make decisions."
  - "internship program is to make people identify as New Yorkers"
