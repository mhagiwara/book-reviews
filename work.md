* Barbara Oakley. A Mind For Numbers, Penguin Group LLC, 2014.
  - Brain works on a problem if you try hard to solve it before falling asleep.
  - "The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be."
  - Procrastination only leaves you superficial focused-mode learning.
  - Brain uses two different modes: focused/diffuse
  - Deliberately switch to diffuse mode: nap, walk, bus, bath, bed
  - "Start early on your assignments and, unless you are really enjoying what you are doing, keep your working sessions short." (as if muscles need time to rest)
  - Don't let things go untouched for longer than a day. Work in small doses, a little every day
  - Dream about what you are studying
  - "The best predictor of how many creative works we produce in our lifetime is ... the number of works we produce."
  - Facebook motto: "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
  - Best language programs (like Defence Language Institute) incorporates both focused mode and diffuse mode
  - "Recalling" the material is far more effective than simply rereading the material.
  - Interleave mixture of different kinds of problems. Avoid overlearning (waste of time).
  - On procrastination "The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself."
  - Focus on process instead of product.
  - "Testing effect" - Testing in itself is a powerful learning experience.
  - Special place devoted just to working is particularly helpful for avoiding procrastination.
  - Plan your quitting time (time to go home)
  - "Willpower is a lot like muscle. You have to use your muscles to strengthen and develop them over time. But at any given time, your muscles have only so much energy available."
  - Regular exercise (both aerobic and resistance) can make a substantive improvement in your memory and learning abilities.
  - Take pride in who you are, especially in the qualities that make you "different," and use them as a secret talisman for success.
  - The number of acquaintances you have - not the number of good friends - predicts your access to the latest ideas as well as your success on the job market.
  - When taking a test, start with the hard problem, but quickly jump to the easy ones.
  - Shift your thinking from "this test has made me afraid" to "this test has got me excited to do my best!" improves the performance.

* Stuart Diamond. "Getting More: How You Can Negotiate to Succeed in Work and Life," 2012
  - Be dispassionate, prepare, find the decision-maker, focus on your goals, make human contact
  - Focus on achieving your goals (not who is right)
  - Negotiate incrementally
  - Trade things you value unequally (e.g., a lower price for more referrals)
  - Don't be manipulative, don't deceive people
  - "Common enemies bring parties closer together and make the negotiation easier."
  - Problems forcing people to do something - the moment you use raw power over someone, the relationship is usually over
  - Get creative!
  - Getting people to feel what you want (you care about their feelings -> they listen more)
  - "The mere act of setting a goal has been shown to increase performance by more than 25 percent."
  - Your credibility is more important than you expertise, connections, intelligence, assets, and looks.
  - Woman are better negotiators <- listen more, collect information, try to learn negotiation tools
  - Don't just learn the tools. PRACTICE them so that you can use them in real time (operational knowledge).
  - John Nash -> proved mathematically that when parties collaborate the pie expands (e.g., 4 hunters get a deer instead of four rabbits)
  - 55% of the reasons people reach agreement -> whether "people" like you or not
  - Differences are profitable - diversity leads to more outcomes.
  - Kids have little power -> give them power proactively
  - Kids are incremental -> make them clean the quarter of your room
  - Quote company policy ("value customers"), find out exceptions made
  - Situational Negotiation: What are my goals? Who are they? What will it take to persuade them?
  - Be persistent: more people than you think will help you, let you keep trying. Persistence builds self-confidence

* "Shane Show: "Smartcuts: How Hackers, Innovators, and Icons Accelerate Success", 2014.
  - Momentum is a big predictor of personal/career success
  - Many of American presidents didn't climb the traditional sense of ladders. They "hacked" it

  - Astro Teller at Google[x] "It's often easier to make something 10 times better than it is to make it 10 times better."
  - Don't reach for low hanging fruit. Competition decreases performance.

*  Greg McKeown "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less" Crown Business, 2014.

  - "If you could do only one thing with your life right now, what would you do?"
  - "learned helplessness" - experiment on German shepherds where dogs who took electric shocks didn't know they even have any choices
  - Warren Buffet and his firm make relatively few investments and keep them for a long time. "Sometimes what you don't do is just as important as what you do."

  - Make an "Essential intent" both inspirational and concrete. e.g., "To get everyone in the U.K. online by the end of 2012." How will we know when we have succeeded?
  - "either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years."
  - Saying "no" gracefully doesn't have to mean using the word "no" e.g., "Let me check my calendar and get back to you", pause before speaking

  - "if you can eliminate one obstacle -- just one! -- you can double the number of people you hire."
  - "design adds value faster than it adds cost"
  - Research on CS 323, programming-intensive course: "The quality of the work and the amount of time spent are simply uncorrelated."
  - '"average productive" developer never hits the high notes that make great software.'
  - "The software marketplae, these days, is something of a winner-take-all system."
  - "The great software developers, indeed, the best people in every field, are quite simply never on the market."
  - 1. Go to the mountain (= interesting tech conferences)  2. Internships  3. Build your own community* (=hard)
  - "it's really important that the ones who do pass have a positive experience. Even the ones who don't make it go back to campus thinking we're a classy employer and tell all their friends how much fun they had staying in a luxury hotel in the Big Apple"
  - All else being equal, developers are going to prefer an organization that treats them like starts.
  - "one of the best ways you can attract developers is to let them work on something interesting."

* Joe Kutner "The Healthy Programmer" The Pragmatic Programmers, 2013
  - New assumption in revolution: human brain evolved due to exercise (not cognitive performance)
  - "Healthy Stand-Up" What did I do yesterday to improve my health? What will I do today to improve my health? Is there anything blocking me from staying healthy?
  - Exercise before or after learning -> better performance (neuron connection strenghthening protein)
  - Buy a pedometer - simply wearing a pedometer is correlated to taking more steps
  - Best intensity level for exercise - 114 BPM heartrate for average 30 year old
  - Normal resting heart rate (60 - 90 BPM; in my case 70 BPM) -> lower the better (e.g., lose weight, quit smoking, reduce stress)
  - amount of time a person sits is directly associated with mortality from all causes (independent of physical activity), which standing can reduce
  - 5 minutes of activity per hour can counteract most of the negative effects of sitting
  - No single position is perfect. Change positions every 20 minutes.
