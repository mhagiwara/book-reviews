      - Brain works on a problem if you try hard to solve it before falling asleep.
      - "The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be."
      - Procrastination only leaves you superficial focused-mode learning.
      - Brain uses two different modes: focused/diffuse
      - Deliberately switch to diffuse mode: nap, walk, bus, bath, bed
      - "Start early on your assignments and, unless you are really enjoying what you are doing, keep your working sessions short." (as if muscles need time to rest)
      - Don't let things go untouched for longer than a day. Work in small doses, a little every day
      - Dream about what you are studying
      - "The best predictor of how many creative works we produce in our lifetime is ... the number of works we produce."
      - Facebook motto: "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
      - Best language programs (like Defence Language Institute) incorporates both focused mode and diffuse mode
      - "Recalling" the material is far more effective than simply rereading the material.
      - Interleave mixture of different kinds of problems. Avoid overlearning (waste of time).
      - On procrastination "The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself."
      - Focus on process instead of product.
      - "Testing effect" - Testing in itself is a powerful learning experience.
      - Special place devoted just to working is particularly helpful for avoiding procrastination.
      - Plan your quitting time (time to go home)
      - "Willpower is a lot like muscle. You have to use your muscles to strengthen and develop them over time. But at any given time, your muscles have only so much energy available."
      - Regular exercise (both aerobic and resistance) can make a substantive improvement in your memory and learning abilities.
      - Take pride in who you are, especially in the qualities that make you "different," and use them as a secret talisman for success.
      - The number of acquaintances you have - not the number of good friends - predicts your access to the latest ideas as well as your success on the job market.
      - When taking a test, start with the hard problem, but quickly jump to the easy ones.
      - Shift your thinking from "this test has made me afraid" to "this test has got me excited to do my best!" improves the performance.

* Understanding Second Language Acquisition
    - Chapter 7 - Foreign Language Aptitude
        - Contrasting examples: Julie (picked up Arabic in 2.5 years) vs Wes (struggled with English even after 3+ years)
        - Aptitude and motivation - researched most in the SAL community
        - MLAT (Modern Language Aptitude Test) - successful in predicting language learning rate in formal settings
        - Test three cognitive abilities: grammatical sensitivity, phonetic coding ability and
        - MLAT criticisms: 1) focus of memory component on rote memorization (vs dynamic memory models) 2) modern SLA is interested in highest attainable proficiency, and various learning conditions (implicit vs explicit)
        - intelligence, first language ability, and foreign language ability overlap, but are sufficiently different from one another
        - Dufva et al. 2011: phonological memory -> L1 phonological awareness + attained L2 (English) proficiency
        - Case studies on individuals with colossal foreign language talents: exceptional verbal memory abilities
        - Listening proficiency in L2 correlates with recall of L2 words in passages (r = 0.57) and repetition of exact same sentences
        - After a threshold size of vocabulary, vocabulary learning is boosted not by memory capacity but by existing L2 mental lexicon
        - 'good memory helps vocabulary learning in the beginning and grammar learning later on' (suggested by O'Brien et al 2006)
        - Aptitude (analytical ability) matters gradually more as starting age is older.
        - Mixed empirical evidence on: if aptitude matters for implicit learning, explicit learning, or both.
        - Interactions of aptitude with other variables (motivation, attention, etc.)
        - Aptitude-treatment interaction research: placing students into audiolingualims/audiovisualism courses based on their MLAT phonetic coding ability scores (statistically significant)
        -
    - Chapter 8 -
        - Attitude / Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) with three dimensions: effort, enjoyment, investment
        - Integrativeness (a genuine interest in learning the second language in order to come closer to the other language community.) - later attracted criticisms for being too narrow
        - Antecedents investigated in L2 motivational research: attitude towards the L2 community, integrativeness, attitude towards instructional settings, orientations, social support, inter-group contact, ethnovitality ('sociopolitical presence of the language in the community'), self-confidence when using the language
        - Orientation (reason): instrumental (e.g., jobs), knowledge, travel, friendship, integrative
        - LLOS (Language Learning Orientation Scales; Noels et al. 2000)
        - (Noels et al. 1999) Environments that are controlling and thwarting self regulation and autonomy erode intrinsic motivation.
        - Dörnyei's critique: integrativeness might have less power for learners in foreign language learning (EFL) context.
        - (Clément et al. 1994) Hungarian students: xenophilic orientation instead of friendship orientation. English media orientation.
        - (Yashima et al. 2004) international posture: interests in international vocation, tendency to approach dissimilar others, and interest in foreign affairs
        - Students in areas with more tourism (more foreigners) tend to have negative attitudes
        - (Inbar et al. 2001) study on Hebrew-speaking Israeli children: actually learning the language might develop positive attitudes; motivation was best predicted by the quality of intsruction
        - Dynamic motivation model: not a generalized trait, but a state trait (Gardner et al. 2004) which changes over time
        - Dörnyei: L2 Motivational Self System: Ideal L2 Self, Ought-to L2 Self, L2 Learning Experience.
        - The power of motivation: scores of AMTB explains 9% (r = 0.30) to 16% (r = 0.40) of L2 achievement (e.g., proficiency test scores)
        - Motivation and outcome are not causal but reciprocal.


* Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology
    - High utility: practice testing and distributed practice
    - Moderate utility: elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, interleaved practice
    - Low utility: Summarization, highlighting, keyword mnemonic, imagery use of text learning, and rereading
    - Four categories for generalizability: materials (e.g., vocabulary, translation equivalents, ...), learning conditions, student characteristics, criterion tasks
    - 8 Practice testing
        - vs high stake, administered tests
        - direct effects: testing enhances retention by triggering elaborative retrieval process.
        - mediated effects: testing facilitates the encoding of more effective mediators during subsequent restudy opportunities.
        - most research on cued recall, but free recall, short-answer questions, fill-in-the-blank questions. free recall is most effective.
        - more practice is better, but with diminishing returns
        - immediate tests have smaller effects than spaced tests (longer the better)
        - confirmed effects on various materials (word pairs, text contents, visual/spacial information, etc.)
        - ease of implementation e.g., flashcards or Cornell note-taking system
    - 9 Distributed practice
        - spreading study content over time
        - (Bahrick, 1979) different groups practiced Spanish translation with different intervals between sessions. 30-day retention was highest if sessions were spaced.
        - (Cepeda et al. 2008) criterion performance was best when the lag between sessions was approx. 10 - 20% of the desired retention interval (e.g., 5 years -> 6-12 months apart)
        - (Budé et al. 2011) compared two identical curricula with different time spans (8-week vs 6-month) 6-month group did better on an open-ended test and the final exam
